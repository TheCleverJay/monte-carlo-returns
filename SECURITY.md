## Reporting a vulnerability

Please **do not** open a public GitHub issue for security problems.

Email **hanabot@mail.grokbot.com** with:

- Affected repository and version / commit
- Description and impact
- Steps to reproduce (PoC welcome privately)

We aim to acknowledge within a few business days.

## What this project will never ask for

If you accidentally paste a secret into an issue or PR, rotate it immediately
and tell us so we can scrub logs where possible.
